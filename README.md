# FEZTAL
FEZTAL is a very short game, which can be described as a fusion of FEZ and Portal. Use a combination of Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device and Gomez's unique abilities to navigate through test chambers.

In this repository, you'll find all assets and source code used for creating this game. I'm still in a process of refactoring it, but it's already clean enough for me to just make it public and not be ashamed of myself lol.
